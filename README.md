#### Requirements: 
iOS 12+, as Apple's `Network` framework is a newer one than `Reachability`, which requires iOS >= 12.
macOS 10.14+

#### Libary & Framework used:
- UIKit
- Network
- [SwiftSocket](https://github.com/swiftsocket/SwiftSocket)

  
#### What is supported:
- Utilize `Network` framework to get gateway(router)'s IP address.
- Utilize `SwiftSocket` to get all open ports of current server IP addressï¼Œsupport user to input port range.
- User interface is created in `UIKit`.
- Involve `auto-layout` to adopt all iPhones type.
- Used MVC as design pattern.
- Supported on Dark Mode.
- All images/icons are using Apple's built-in SF Symbol 2.0.

#### Note:
- Only `Gateway Info` & `Port Scan` is functional now. Other functions in the tableView are just placeholder.
- Please use real device to try this app, since network utility app will not work property in iOS simulator most of time.
